# @aponica/mysqlgoose-schema-js

Generates a JSON hash (dictionary) object of mysql table schemas, indexed by 
table name, to be used by 
[@aponica/mysqlgoose-js](https://aponica.com/docs/mysqlgoose-js/)
to create models.

<a name="execution"></a>
## Execution

```sh
npx @aponica/mysqlgoose-schema-js zConfigFile [ zOutFile ]
```

`zConfigFile` must be a JSON file containing the database connection data.
It must contain an object with members as expected by 
[mysqljs/mysql](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql):

```json
{"database":"mysqlgoose_test",
"host":"localhost",
"password":"password",
"user":"mysqlgoose_tester"}
```
 
If `zOutFile` is specified, the output is saved to a file with this name,
without whitespace. If the file exists, it is overwritten. If not specified, 
output is to stdout w/two-space indentation.
